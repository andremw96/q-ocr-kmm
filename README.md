🚀 Excited to share my journey with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) and Jetpack Compose!

In the ever-evolving landscape of mobile app development, embracing cross-platform solutions has become crucial. 🌐 That's why I dove into the world of #KotlinMultiplatformMobile to streamline my development process and bring consistency to my projects across Android and iOS.

🎨 With Jetpack Compose as the UI framework, creating stunning and dynamic interfaces has never been this elegant and efficient. ✨ The declarative nature of Compose allowed me to express UI elements in a more intuitive way, saving time and reducing the chances of errors.

🤝 Collaborating with a shared codebase between platforms has been a game-changer. The ability to write business logic once in Kotlin and share it seamlessly between Android and iOS has significantly sped up development cycles and improved code maintenance. 💡

🔗 Leveraging the power of KMM's platform-specific modules, I was able to integrate platform-specific functionalities without sacrificing the overall code-sharing benefits. This flexibility gave me the best of both worlds!

Here's my simple project, implementing Jetpack Compose on the Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile Project. It's a simple OCR application that is able to extract text from an image using a camera/image picker both from Android and iOS. From the .gif below, the jetpack compose UI able to render both on Android and iOS. but for the image picker, we can use expect and actual class to use the native image picker from Android or iOS.
